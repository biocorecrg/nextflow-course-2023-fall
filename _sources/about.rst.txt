Prerequisite / technical requirements
============


Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory. The course materials is online in the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Practitioners will need to connect during the course to a remote server via the "ssh" protocotol. You can learn about it `here <https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work>`_

Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available in the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. For sake of information, below the basics of `nano <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide>`_

Having a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_ is recommended.
